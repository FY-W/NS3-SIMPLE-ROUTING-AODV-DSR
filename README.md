# NS3-SIMPLE-ROUTING-AODV-DSR
This repository contains the NS3 file for AODV and DSR routing algorithms. The main objective of creating this repository is that, the example files in NS3 are tougher to understand for a beginner. The files are tested on NS-3.24. There are some tweaks to be followed in order to run the animation file in netanim. The doubts, clarrifications and feedbacks are welcome.
